(Sagittarius)\nBlood Type: A\nNationality: Britannia\nHeight: 178 cm (5'10\")\nWeight: 56 kg (123 lbs)\nOccupation: Student, Terrorist, Knightmare Pilot, Politician, Emperor, Prince\nAllegiance: Order of the Black Knights\nPosition: Leader of the Black Knights\nKnightmare: Sutherland, Burai, Gawain, Shinkirou\n\nLelouch is the main protagonist of the anime/manga series Code Geass. He is the Eleventh Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire and the son of the 98th Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia.\n\nLelouch is a very clever individual who is also calm, sophisticated, and arrogant due to his aristocratic upbringing. While at school, Lelouch conducts himself as a friendly, likable, and often an easygoing student. However, this is a mask to hide his true nature. While as Zero, his true nature is expressed. His charisma and beliefs in justice gain him the trust and respect of many soldiers and leaders.\n\nHe is known for having a very stoic personality. He never cared about schoolwork, seeing the entire thing as trivial, even though his high intelligence would make it easy for him. He enjoys seeking out challenges, often playing chess against the nobility. In general, Lelouch takes most day-to-day affairs with open disinterest, often not even noticing the affection of others, especially Shirley, his classmate. He has a strong dislike for nobles, viewing them as tepid and \"overprivileged parasites.\"\n\nMany characters have noted that Lelouch is entirely selfish, as his desire to remake the world into what he wants it to become from his desire to avenge his mother's apparent death and Nunnally's sake. However, in time, he realizes that this goal is not just for them but also the entire world.\n\nDespite his cold, calculating demeanor and ruthlessness in battle, he can be a rather compassionate person to his friends and loved ones. To Nunnally, he is a loving older brother, and to Suzaku, a loyal friend, although the two are enemies. Lelouch, at first glance, seems to have relatively little concern for the well-being of his subordinates, but in reality, he does care about them, seeing them as valuable allies.\n\n\nBackground (as Lelouch):\n\nBackground (as Zero):\n\nFirst Season:\n\nSecond Season:\n\n\nGeass:\nLelouch's Geass, bestowed upon him by C.C., gives him \"The Power of Absolute Obedience,\" allowing him to plant commands within a person's mind upon eye contact in a manner comparable to hypnosis. Activation of his Geass is visually represented by the manifestation of a Geass Sigil in his left eye. Commands dictated are written into the minds of the designated targets, the Sigil projecting him from his eye to theirs.\n\n\nOf all the Geass abilities in the series, Lelouch's has been explored the most and also seems to have the most restrictions, and side effects of any Geass introduced:(Source: Code Geass Wiki, Villains Wiki, Heroes Wiki, Anime and Manga Universe Wiki)"

There are rumors that he was originally part of underground crime before he became a soldier. Although he often appears to be unfriendly, he cares deeply for his team and has never undervalued human life.

At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in a childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.\n\nLuffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young male hero/adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy's case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial \"D.\"\n\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism, and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D's. His only display of true fear is towards his grandfather, to the point that he is intimidated at the mere mention of him.\n\nLuffy never kills any of his enemies, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or beating them to a point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Oda explains that it's not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.\n\nLuffy's dream is to find the One Piece and become Pirate King. He knows that to achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks."

He never shows his face to the world, instead of representing himself with a capital L in Cloister Black font. After meeting the Kira investigation team, he requests that the task force refers to him as Ryuzaki for discretion. The Kira investigation team never learns his true name.\n\nL's disheveled and languid appearance masks his great powers of deduction and insight. He tends to second-guess everything he is presented with and is extremely meticulous and analytical. He has several quirks such as preferring to crouch rather than sit, eating only sweet foods like desserts and fruits, and holding items very delicately. He stayed in England for five years, and during that time he was the champion in tennis for the England Junior Cup.\n\nL suggests that even though he eats only sweet foods, he remains underweight because the brain uses the most calories of any organ in the body. He also says that if he sits normally, his reasoning ability would drop 40%.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, Death Note Profiles)"

Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style). This is achieved by using one katana in each hand and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his bandana, normally tied on the arm, on his head.\n\nThough not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood.\n\nZoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but, unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.\n\nZoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only because he knows he's a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed, and determined."

He is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, who likes to assume his \"true name\" \"Kyouma Hououin\" (鳳凰院凶真, Hououin Kyouma), and often uses this to introduce himself to others. Usually, people do not care and instead address him by his actual name or by 'Okarin' (his nickname), much to his chagrin.\n\nOkabe is also socially inept; his social skills were so poor that Kurisu considers the childlike Mayuri to be usual by comparison. However, he isn't hesitant to lend a helping hand to people whom he'd never met. Although very intelligent, Okabe is easily deceived by others.\n\nOkabe likes to pose as an agent working against a specific \"Organization,\" which he suggests is always after him, as he believes this kind of image gives him an excellent and mysterious aura. However, this seems to disappear as the story progresses, with SERN likely replacing the \"Organization's\" villainous image. He usually gives off the impression of being delusional and paranoid, displaying eccentric mannerisms such as talking to himself on the phone and engaging in fits of maniacal laughter.\n\n\n\nCharacter Background:\n\nTimeline:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: Steins;Gate Wiki, Wikipedia)"

                "about": "Age: 15-16 (series), 18 (movie, end of the series)\nBirthday: 1899\nBirthplace: Resembool, Amestris\nFamily: Alphonse Elric (brother), Trisha Elric (mother, deceased), Van Hohenheim (father)\nAffiliations: State Military, Winry Rockbell, Pinako Rockbell, Izumi Curtis (teacher), Roy Mustang (Commander)\nSpecies: Human\nOccupation: State Alchemist\nAbilities: Alchemy, Martial Arts\nWeapon: Alchemy, Automail arm and leg\n\nEdward \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" Elric is a young alchemical prodigy. He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed's primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a \"hero of the people\" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn't seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al's suffering.\n\nEdward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4'11\"), however, his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. Although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, Ed's ability to fight is not impaired and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. His heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in Amestris. They were made by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. He is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. These qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter.\n\nBorn to Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim of Resembool in the winter of 1899, Edward's first few years were relatively happy; but after the sudden departure of his father during the lad's formative years, Ed was left with his mother and younger brother Alphonse as his only family. The three Elrics lived in peace in the rural village and the boys began displaying a remarkable talent for alchemy at a young age, much to the joyful astonishment of his mother. However, early in the year 1904, Trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. Even while mourning, mired in grief, Edward vowed to his brother that the two of them would find a way to bring their dead mother back to life with the power of alchemy.\n\nEdward and Alphonse spent the next few years living on their own in the Elric family home, supported by their close childhood friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako, and pursuing the alchemical knowledge necessary for their planned resurrection. Although they had gained a great deal of information and comprehension regarding the extended basics of the craft, before long it became apparent to the young prodigies that there was only so far they could go while being self-taught. In a stroke of good fortune, Resembool was visited by an exceptionally skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis who, after some persuasion, agreed to take the Elric brothers on as her apprentices provided they pass a preliminary test. After they do, the Elric brothers were subjected to Izumi's intensive alchemy and martial arts training, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to Resembool. \n\nThough instructed specifically by Izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the \"One is All, All is One\" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics of a forbidden practice called Human Transmutation.\n\nDevising a Human Transmutation Circle, amassing the elemental ingredients for an adult human body and offering their own blood as soul and biological data, the boys secretly initiated the Human Transmutation in their home. Unfortunately, the Human Transmutation resulted in a Rebound.\n\nAlphonse and Edward were pulled into The Gate. Encountering the mysterious being called Truth, Edward was stripped of his left leg in exchange for crossing into God's domain and peeking at the Gate's vast wealth of alchemical knowledge. Maimed and bleeding, Edward was returned to the human dimension to find that Alphonse had not yet returned from his disappearance into the Gate, that the mother they had attempted to revive was a grotesque mass of organs only capable of sustaining life for a few moments and that his own sojourn into the Gate had granted him the curious ability to perform transmutations merely by clapping his hands together, without the aid of a Transmutation Circle - in the same style used by Izumi. Desperate to at least have his brother by his side, Edward willfully performed another Human Transmutation to call him back, this time sacrificing his right arm in exchange for Al's soul, which he bound alchemically to an antique suit of armor with a Blood Rune before passing out from severe blood loss. Alphonse carried Ed to the Rockbell house, where a shocked Pinako and Winry performed emergency surgery to save the young boy's life.\n\nOn the night of the failed transmutation. Lt. Colonel Flame Alchemist Roy Mustang came to the Rockbell's in response to a letter that Edward and Alphonse had sent him in the mail asking about their Father. He was shocked at the fact that the two boys had tried human alchemy and survived, and informed them that they could become state alchemist and maybe one day find a way to return their bodies to the way they were. Desperate to get His younger brother's body back, Edward asked the Rockbells to give him prosthetic limbs called automail. Though they warned him the surgery would be painful, he said the pain was nothing compared to what his brother had given up. He only took a year to adapt to the automail at age 11 when it took most adults three years."

When born, a powerful nine-tailed demon fox attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage, the leader of the Hidden Leaf Village, sealed the demon fox within Naruto's newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.\n\nDespite the Fourth Hokage's dying wish that Naruto be viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a Jinchuuriki) the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demon were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracized by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto.\n\nNaruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Coy, raffish and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to \"Team Seven\" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.\n\nVowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.\n\nIn all, Naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers."

To add to his troubles, oppressive aliens have moved in to invade planet Earth. Gintoki works taking on odd jobs alongside two kids: Kagura and Shinpachi. In the Joui war, he was known as the \"White Devil\" (Shiroyasha) due to his silver hair and white clothing he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear in the hearts of the Amanto.\n\nGintoki has naturally permed silver hair, which he blames for his lacking love-life. He has a big crush on the TV's news weather girl, Ketsuno. In fact, to date, the only time he is seen to have blushed is when he tries to make use of Sadaharu and Ketsuno's dog to get a chance to talk to her.(Though he later does with Tsukuyo as well when she discovers him shopping) Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response and merely puts up with them as annoyances.\n\nGintoki has two major obsessions in life. He is obsessed with sweet food such as parfaits, ice cream and cakes. His second obsession is reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Shounen Jump. (Which, not coincidentally, is where Gintama is published). Gintoki will go to great lengths to get the latest Jump issue, to the point of reckless behavior. His Jump obsession makes him dream of being like other Jump heroes, including wishing that he had a \"Bankai\" similar to the characters of Bleach.\n\nDespite his appearance and initial behavior, Gintoki has a great amount of pride for the old bushido code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he's barely acquainted with, be it a pit-fighter who was taking care of abandoned orphans or an Amanto who resembles a kappa.\n\nDespite being a fearsome fighter with nearly unmatched skills, he avoids needless bloodshed after suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joui war.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, VS Battles Wiki, edited)"

Run, run and cling to life.\n\nBackground:\nItachi Uchiha is a missing-nin from Konohagakure, and a prominent member of Akatsuki, partnered with Kisame Hoshigaki. He is Sasuke Uchiha's older brother. \n\nItachi is relatively popular among many fans of Naruto, often having ranked in the top ten in Shonen Jump magazine's popularity polls since his introduction. He was first ranked in the third character popularity poll ranked in 11th place. He was ranked 9th place during the fourth popularity poll, and 6th place in the fifth popularity poll. During the sixth popularity poll, he again was ranked in 11th place. In the last poll, he was ranked in 5th place.\n\nItachi was born into the Uchiha clan and was praised by all as the best of his generation - a genius above all others. Even by the standards of the battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi's prowess far outshined all others. However, not even his family, friends, or teachers could understand him. When he was only 4, Itachi had already witnessed countless lives lost due to the Third Great Shinobi World War, which emotionally traumatized him and turned him into a pacifist. At age 7, he graduated from the Ninja Academy at the top of his class after only one year, mastered the Sharingan at age 8, passed the Chunin Exams at age 10, and became ANBU Captain at age 13. According to Madara Uchiha, Itachi also had a lover, whom he killed during the Uchiha clan massacre.\n\nHe was praised highly by his father, who saw the family's future in Itachi, hence neglecting his other son - Itachi's younger brother, Sasuke. However, during this time Itachi showed great affection towards his little brother, Sasuke, and even encouraged his father to come to the Academy when Sasuke was enrolled, something their dad had otherwise forgotten, by saying that he would not go to an important mission, that would establish Itachi a place in the ANBU ranks, otherwise.\n\n\nPersonality:\n\nAs a member of Akatsuki, he possessed incredible self-control of his emotions. He constantly displayed an emotionless personality. He only showed surprise when opponents proved more powerful or skilled than he had expected, and even then he didn't lose his composure. He did not possess any arrogance, and fully justified any statements he made about his power, even complimenting his opponents at times on their abilities.\n\nIn addition to being an extremely powerful ninja, Itachi had equally impressive intelligence, and was shown to be very wise. He was exceedingly sharp and observant to any situation at hand, as he was rarely surprised or caught off guard. He also displayed great intuition, as he was almost never deceived and even then almost instantly realized the truth. Despite his status as a wanted criminal, and having murdered a significant portion of his family, Itachi took no enjoyment in violence or combat, instead preferring to avoid battle or, if this was not possible, end it as quickly as he could.\n\nItachi's only initial interest was in Akatsuki's goals, and his only loyalties appeared to be to the organization and its members, seeming to put the organization's success and secrecy before everything else. As such, Itachi got along with his partner, Kisame, much better than most other Akatsuki members did with their own partners. Kisame appeared to have a deep loyalty to Itachi, immediately doing as he instructed and constantly looking out for his well-being. Itachi treated all of his fellow Akatsuki members to this same, more respectful personality, although his courtesy was rarely returned by the other members.\n\n\nDespite his status as an infamous shinobi, his appearance was not the most intimidating, apart from the intensity of his eyes. While living in Konoha, he would regularly have a gentle and caring look in his eyes, especially directed towards his younger brother. After joining Akatsuki, he would regularly have a stern look to them. He was a fairly tall shinobi, whose basic appearance was very much like the rest of his clan.\n\nHe, like all members of his clan, possessed dark grey eyes, and also had black hair that hung near his cheeks to frame his face. He also had the addition of a long ponytail in the back of his hair (which he obscured with his Akatsuki cloak after joining the organization). Being brothers, Itachi and Sasuke had a similar appearance, but with subtle differences. Itachi's hair color appeared slightly duller and with a softer flow to it, without the spiky style at the back. His skin was also slightly darker. Itachi's most distinguishing characteristics were the long pronounced creases under his eyes.\n\nWhen he lived in Konoha, his casual clothes would consist of a black shirt with a large Uchiha clan symbol on the back of it, and black pants with a weapons pouch strapped to them. When on duty, he would wear the traditional ANBU uniform, although he was never shown wearing a mask. As a member of Akatsuki, he wore the traditional Akatsuki cloak, and usually kept the center of it buttoned down. After his cloak was incinerated by Sasuke's Kirin during their fight in Part II, it was revealed that he still wore his casual clothes underneath it. Like almost all members of Akatsuki, he wore the headband of his home village, Konoha, with a line gouged through it, to symbolize his broken ties with the village \nAbilities:\nSince a young age, Itachi's intellect and talent showed their brilliance in everything he did, as even his teachers said his progress hardly required any help. In the few battles he had been seen in since the start of the series, Itachi was shown to be an incredibly powerful ninja, and easily one of the strongest in the Naruto series, as demonstrated by his ability to easily defeat Deidara, Sasuke, Kakashi Hatake, Kurenai Yuhi and Orochimaru (twice), who themselves are considered amongst the strongest ninjas in Naruto. Being a pacifist, Itachi did not actively take part in battle, typically only acting in self-defense.\n\nSharingan:\nBeing of the Uchiha Clan, and as noted by Kakashi, Itachi was a true successor of the Sharingan Eye. From a stationary position, he would study an opponent's movements with his Sharingan and respond accordingly, often with a genjutsu. He could cast a genjutsu by merely pointing at or looking at someone, and could similarly turn an opponent's genjutsu against them with Demonic Illusion: Mirror Heaven and Earth Change. Itachi had trained so much with his eyes that he had reached the stage where he could have his Sharingan activated the entire time, with minimal drain on his chakra levels. \n\nMangekyo Sharingan:\nItachi possessed the Mangekyo Sharingan, which increased his already great power, and enabled him to use his most powerful techniques. With his left eye, he could use Tsukuyomi, a genjutsu that traps an opponent's mind in an illusionary world, torturing them for what seems like days in a matter of seconds.With his right eye he could use Amaterasu, a ninjutsu which allowed him to create a black flame that he could direct by moving his eye to burn through seemingly anything in its path, including fire itself. His final technique was Susanoo, a technique that manifested itself as a spectral being, labelled as the \"Raging God of Battle\" in the databook. It wielded the Totsuka Sword, an ethereal sword with the ability to seal anything it pierces into the gourd that serves as its hilt, and Yata's Mirror, a shield that can reflect any attack. Zetsu, a fellow Akatsuki member, stated that Itachi's mastery of the Sharingan, combined with the legendary weapons of Susanoo, made him invincible.\n\n\n(Source: Naruto.com, Naruto Wikia)"

Cunning and manipulative, Rize uses her charms and Kaneki's attraction toward her as a means of getting her next \"meal.\" After the attack, Kaneki is rushed to the hospital in a half-dead state with Rize. A doctor of the name Kanou, who secretly experiments with ghouls, humans, and half-ghouls, transplants what Kaneki believes to be a kidney into his body as a means of saving his life in the dire situation. Soon he learns that he had part of Rize's kagune transplanted into him, becoming the first of many human-ghoul experiments Kanou will conduct.\n\nDue to the unnatural abundance of RC Cells now present in his body because of Rize's kagune, Kaneki loses the ability to stomach human food, often getting sick or vomiting when ingesting any, and gains the powers of regeneration and kagune usage as a result. Because of his morals and attachment to humanity, Kaneki refuses to consume human beings as a means to sustain himself, even when the meat is obtained through non-violent means, rather he consumes large amounts of coffee, and, when absolutely necessary, will cannibalize other ghouls.\n\nLater, he joins with several ghouls, Banjou and Tsukiyama Shuu, in order to reduce the number of ghouls that cause havoc in the world to make the lives of humans better. Due to the nature of his ghoul mask and physical features, Kaneki earns himself the name \"One-Eye\" among the ghoul-community, and eventually \"Centipede\" when his kagune takes the form of one after he is put under immense stress, pressure, and anxiety. The CCG eventually dub him to be an SS-Rated ghoul.\n\n\n\nTokyo Ghoul:re\n\n\n(Source: Tokyo Ghoul Wiki)"

Kakashi, however, seems indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and Kakashi has acquired a record of 49 wins and 50 losses in doing so. Given that the contests that make up this figure are so varied (ranging from Rock, Paper, Scissors to sumo-wrestling), this is not much of an achievement on Guy's part. Nevertheless, Guy is proud of his record.\n\nThough he evasively says that he has \"many hobbies\" when asked about himself, he is commonly seen reading of \"Icha Icha Paradise\" (イチャイチャパラダイス, Icha Icha Paradaisu, literally \"Make Out Paradise\"), an adult and probably pornographic novel authored by Jiraiya that is a runaway bestseller in the Naruto world. Kakashi most prominently reads it while training and speaking with his team, and is later seen reading the second known volume in the series, \"Icha Icha Violence\" (イチャイチャバイオレンス, Icha Icha Baiorensu, literally \"Make Out Violence\"). In Part II Naruto gives him the new \"Icha Icha Tactics\" (イチャイチャタクティクス, Icha Icha Takutikusu, literally \"Make Out Tactics\").\n\nKakashi's Sharingan eye gives him a significant advantage in battle, as he can copy enemy techniques and use them as his own, as well as track and predict his opponent's movements flawlessly. Because it is a transplanted eye, his Sharingan eye is always active. While this would not be much of a problem for an Uchiha, his non-Uchiha blood causes it to use much more chakra than it should. Because of this, he covers it with his headband and only utilizes it in the most dangerous battles. Kakashi's use of the Sharingan is as good as that of Itachi Uchiha, though the aforementioned handicaps brought about by the nature of his eye make him somewhat weaker in comparison. In Part II Kakashi is able to develop his own Mangekyo Sharingan. With his variant he is able to manipulate space-time to conduct long range attacks, and in its two uses has been capable of severing another's arms and otherwise sending things to different dimensions. Much like the standard Sharingan, the Mangekyo Sharingan tires Kakashi considerably, and after using it only three times he was hospitalized for a week due to its chakra usage.\n\nWith his Sharingan Kakashi has been able to copy more than one thousand jutsu, giving him the nickname \"Copy Ninja Kakashi\". As a result, Kakashi's arsenal most prominently features ninjutsu abilities and has led to him becoming a specialist in the field. Many of the jutsu he has been seen copying in the series are water-based attacks, though most of these he only uses against the person he copies them from. He does, however, use Water Release: Water Encampment Wall on occasion as a way to block attacks. He less frequently uses other elemental attacks such as Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique to attack opponents or Earth Release: Inner Decapitation Technique (土遁・心中斬首の術, Doton: Shinjū Zanshu no Jutsu, Viz \"Groundhog Technique Decapitation\", English TV \"Headhunter Jutsu\") to pull opponents below ground and immobilize them. He can also create shadow clones, though because he lacks Naruto's chakra reserves, he exercises the ability with caution, rarely creating more than one at a time.\n\nWhile Kakashi specializes in the use of ninjutsu due to his Sharingan he is fairly adept with other jutsu types, though his use of them is rarely seen. Demonic Illusion: Hell Viewing Technique (魔幻・奈烙見の術, Magen: Narakumi no Jutsu) causes his opponent to see what they would find a horrifying vision, keeping them preoccupied until they can overcome the illusion. A Thousand Years of Pain (death in english dub) (千年殺し, Sennen Goroshi) consists of Kakashi forcefully plunging his index and middle fingers into an opponent's rectum. While only capable of launching the opponent humorous distances in typical uses, the fingers can be replaced with kunai attached with exploding tags to actually do damage to the person one is attacking.\n\nWhen he was younger, Kakashi was taught how to use the Rasengan by the Fourth Hokage. Because the Rasengan is meant to have the user's chakra nature mixed with it, Kakashi attempted to add his lightning-based chakra to it, though was ultimately unsuccessful. In time he instead created the Chidori, his only original jutsu. After the jutsu's initial creation, Kakashi was unable to use the Chidori to its full potential as the sheer speed of the attack left his normal eyes unable to see any form of an enemy counterattack. After acquiring the Sharingan, however, he was able to overcome this shortcoming. Through repeated use and increased proficiency with it, Kakashi's Chidori has been upgraded and renamed to the Lightning Blade due to him having cut through a bolt of lightning with it."

The inspiration for Spike is found in martial artist Bruce Lee who uses the martial arts style of Jeet Kune Do as depicted in Session 8, \"Waltz For Venus\". He has fluffy, dark green hair (which is inspired by Yusaku Matsuda's) and reddish brown eyes, one of which is artificial and lighter than the other. He is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and Lupin III inspired boots. A flashback in Session 6 revealed it was his fully functioning right eye which was surgically replaced by the cybernetic one (although Spike himself may not have conscious recollection of the procedure since he claims to have lost his natural eye in an \"accident\"). One theory is that his natural eye may have been lost during the pre-series massacre in which he supposedly \"died\". The purpose of this cybernetic eye is never explicitly stated, though it apparently gives him exceptional hand-eye coordination - particularly with firearms (Spike's gun of choice is a Jericho 941, as seen throughout the series). In the first episode, when facing a bounty-head using Red Eye, Spike mocks him, calling his moves \"too slow\". At first, this seems like posturing on Spike's part, but even with his senses and reflexes accelerated to superhuman levels by the drug, the bounty cannot even touch Spike. A recurring device throughout the entire show is a closeup on Spike's fully-natural left eye before dissolving to a flashback of his life as part of the syndicate. As said by Spike himself in the last episode, his right eye \"only sees the present\" and his left eye \"only sees the past.\" Spike often has a bent cigarette between his lips, sometimes despite rain or \"No Smoking\" signs."

She introduces herself as Satella when she and Subaru met during the first timeline before introducing herself by her real name when she got her insignia back.\n\nEmilia is good natured and likes to take care of others, though she herself refuses to admit it, instead thinking of it as her own selfishness. She is indifferent to her own appearance, leaving Puck to take care of her clothes and hair.

She is a notable actress/model and a third year at Minegahara High School, the same school as Sakuta Azusagawa.\n\nMai is a serious individual, especially around Sakuta Azusagawa. She is very sensitive, polite, levelheaded, helpful, and kind. She isn't harsh by default, but she can become easily annoyed and come across as somewhat snappy or violent especially to Sakuta. Mai tends to ignore and stuff down unpleasant feelings rather than deal with them. Sakuta often points out that she is \"dishonest\", often lying about her feelings. Despite her snarkiness, she's pure-hearted and even shy around Sakuta's jokes. Mai is also very intelligent; she's implied to have very good grades and even helps Sakuta study at one point. \n\nMai found early fame as a model for television, magazines, and books due to the fact that her mother ran a photographing agency. While she did enjoy her job as a model in the show business, the pressure of being in the public began to take its toll on her. After being tricked and forced to participate in a swimsuit photoshoot by her mother in her early school years, Mai realized she was simply being used as a tool to make her mother easy money and took a hiatus from acting as a way to get back at her, deciding to attend highschool. \n\nHowever, because of work commitments made prior to her decision to go on hiatus she wasn't able to attend school until half-way through her first year. By then, social circles had formed, making her the \"odd one out\" and causing her to be isolated. As a result, the student body didn't know how to deal with her; While they had no reason to bully her, they also feared associating with her would cause themselves to be isolated as well.\n\n\n\nTwo years and several months since beginning her hiatus, Mai went to a library wearing a bunny costume to see if anyone would notice her. She then came across a boy named Sakuta Azusagawa, who was the only person in the building able to see her. After introducing themselves, however, Mai ordered Sakuta to forget about her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: Seishun Buta Yarou Wiki)"

Using special gloves that create a spark when he snaps his fingers, Roy can create anything from a tiny ember to burn a letter, to a raging inferno that can destroy a humanoid body in seconds. His precise control over the alchemically enhanced flame is so accurate that he can boil the water in a persons' eyes and can also attack enemies amongst a riot without hurting any allies.\n\nOutwardly arrogant and playfully manipulative, Mustang is intelligent and almost always one step ahead of his opponents, and likes to feel in control of the situation. He is one of the superiors of Edward Elric. On the surface, he appears to be nothing more than a man of the military who pursues promotions and praise and is considered a ladies' man who constantly goes on dates with different women. Mustang's true goal is to become Führer in order to gain the power to reform the government in order to absolve his sins in the Ishval War as well as change the country for the better, along with the joking requirement for female officers to wear tiny miniskirts (which considerably increased Havoc's loyalty to him and caused Hawkeye to be angry with him).\n\nHis goals are admirable enough that he earns the fierce loyalty of his good friends Lt Col. Maes Hughes, Major Alex Louis Armstrong, and his own subordinates, among whom are Riza Hawkeye, Jean Havoc, Heymans Breda, Vato Falman, and Kain Fuery. While Mustang has a close and amicable relationship with all of his subordinates, he appears to share a deeper bond of affection with his second-in-command Riza Hawkeye, who has devoted her life to supporting him. This bond culminates in the final episodes of the anime when Mustang chooses Hawkeye alone to accompany him on his greatest and most dangerous mission.\n\nThough a hero of the Ishval War, he remains haunted by the horrors of war and suffers great remorse for the lives he took.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

He is a fairly tall, and lean-built person with peach skin and brown eyes. Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin. When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears standard Shinigami attire with the addition of a strap across his chest.\n\nWhen he was young, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his world. Ichigo always smiled whenever he was with Masaki and he was regularly at her side, holding her hand.\n\nAs a teenager, Ichigo's personality is much more complex. Stubborn, short-tempered, occasionally confrontational, determined, outspoken, strong-willed and impulsive, he attempts to maintain a detached and \"cool\" image, despite claiming to not care about what other people think about him. He generally keeps his face set in a permanent scowl with his eyebrows drawn together. Ichigo carries the burden of the real world and the spirit world (Soul Society), a task quite difficult, especially for a teenager like Ichigo, who has his own worries and problems. Also, Ichigo is quite smart; he was ranked 23rd in his high school. He does this partly to prove to his teachers and classmates that just because he's unique, or somewhat punkish, that he can still succeed.\n\nWhen Ichigo first becomes a Shinigami, his Zanpakutō is a standard-looking katana, but oversized with an equally-oversized brown sheathe hung by a strap over his right shoulder. It has a rectangular bronze hand guard with gently inward-curved edges, a stylized flame pattern on the long sides, and a simple decorative slit on the short ones. The handle is red with two light blue tassels on the end of the handle. The large size is due to the unfocused but immense amount of Ichigo's spiritual power, which he didn't know how to control. As a result, the sword itself was rather weak, since very little spiritual power was used to create it. Nevertheless, it was powerful enough to subdue a Gillian-class Menos and lesser Hollows, completely blocking a Cero from the former. It was even able to upturn the ground with a single strike. Because of its weak spiritual energy nature, Byakuya Kuchiki was able to easily cut off most of the blade during his first encounter with Ichigo and Kisuke Urahara subsequently slices it down to the hilt during their training, forcing Ichigo to learn the name of his Zanpakutō in order to release its true form. This sword is found to be a result of Rukia's deprived spiritual energy and not a result of his own power."

It was nice to have someone like that.\"\n\nTaiga is a girl in Ryuuji's class. She has a well-regulated and beautiful appearance though is unable to stomach company from others. Due to her often snapping at others in brutal ways and her short stature, she is given the nickname \"Palmtop Tiger.\"\n\nHer under-developed body and the added nickname has given her a complex which in turn serves to give her a negative attitude and facial expression. Essentially, Taiga gets upset easily and is considerably clumsy. She is also brutally honest, typically when she is lashing out at someone. Due to her cute looks (described as a doll by Ryuuji), she often gets confessions of love by boys, but she turns down every one of them, including Yuusaku Kitamura (which she later regrets).\n\nDespite coming from a well-to-do family, her life with them is very difficult because of various problems. Her father and mother got a divorce, leaving Taiga with her father. When he remarried another woman who was significantly younger than himself, it caused misunderstandings between Taiga and her step-mother. One day it became too much for Taiga, causing her to run away from home and since then, she has taken to living on her own. Since she came from a privileged household, she does not know how to do any domestic chores. When she meets Ryuuji and learns of his domestic talents, she ends up relying on Ryuuji to clean up after her. Aside from sleeping in her own house, and going to school, she spends most of her time at Ryuuji's house; so much so that she is considered a member of his family.\n\nAt the beginning of the story, she is infatuated with Ryuuji's best friend Yuusaku Kitamura and gets nervous every time he appears around her. Ryuuji finds out due to a misplaced empty love letter from Taiga meant for Kitamura. Ryuuji then admits to having feelings for Taiga's best friend Minori. Due to this, Taiga and Ryuuji team up to help each other get into a relationship with each other's best friend."

                "about": "Birthdate: August 3, 1975\n\nA 22-year-old, hormonal, blonde-haired biker and virgin, Onizuka Eikichi graduated from a bottom-rung university by cheating and, as such, cannot get a decent job. His main way of spending time is peering up girls' skirts in a local mall. He is very athletic, as he can bench press 150 kg (331 lbs), has a second dan black belt in karate, and even claims to perform 500 push-ups, 1000 pull ups and 2000 squats daily.\n\nThrough the events explained in the Great Teacher Onizuka manga, Onizuka decides to become a teacher, even though it is later implied that he has an IQ of about 50 (Though not necessarily true). His initial teacher training is in the Musashino Public High School, where he meets Nanako Mizuki. His experience taming the rowdy gangs in his assigned class hardens his convictions that teaching is the way to go, and when he learns of Mizuki's problems, he also decides to abstain from sexual experience with his students, opting to solve their personal issues for them, instead.\n\nUnfortunately, he nearly messes up by forgetting to take the public teachers' civil service exam. As a result, no public high school will take him, but he is still eligible for a number of private schools. He manages to get a job at the upper-crust Holy Forest Academy, despite the objections of vice-principal Uchiyamada Hiroshi, whom he continues to aggravate well into his tenure. Of course, one of the conditions of having the job at Holy Forest is that he must sleep at the school—in the storage room at the top floor, with roof access—and it is here that Onizuka officially starts his career in teaching, when he stops Yoshikawa Noboru from committing suicide.\n\nOnizuka is put in charge of class 3-4, a class so bad it has already driven several teachers insane. Not only does he survive the class's brutal bullying tactics, but he also befriends his students, and the backbone to the story of Great Teacher Onizuka consists of his unique experiences in turning his students around and learning lessons of his own.\n\nIt is later implied again, during the National Exams, that Onizuka might actually be some sort of genius. His exam results were swapped: once for full marks, and once for just short of full marks. However, when Yoshito Kikuchi is asked whether he is curious about Onizuka's true results, he checks the answers himself and the result amazes him. He checks with Onizuka, who states that he definitely got perfect results from his own effort (which would be incredible, since he did a 5 hour exam in 1 hour, bleeding, and having 4 bullets in his stomach).\n\nOnizuka has incredible physical resilience. On more than one occasion, he has fallen from heights that would instantly kill most people and claims to have a sort of healing factor, as he healed from a broken arm in less than a day, and even endure multiple gunshot wounds, in a short period of time. Onizuka often presents his strength in unintentionally flamboyant ways, such as arm wrestling over 100 men of exponential strength in a row and winning (including the character Heihachi from the Tekken series of fighting games, and Jason Voorhees from the films called Friday the 13th (series)). His fighting abilities are not to be taken lightly either, as Onizuka is capable of fending off multiple opponents, even if they are well-armed, and almost never receives any physical damage.\n\nIn spite of his impressive fighting skills, Onizuka is often roughed up by his students, and others, whenever he behaves badly. It could be speculated that deep down, Onizuka knows when he's acting immature, and allows others to keep him in line. An example of this is when he forces his students to dig the earth for buried treasure during the Okinawa trip. Kanzaki Urumi kicks Onizuka into a hole, and later forces him to wear S&amp;M garb and has him crawl around on all fours, with Urumi riding on his back. Yet another example is when Principal Uchiyamada has Onizuka over for dinner and hits him upside the head with a wooden bench after finding out that Onizuka was acting a bit of a letch with his daughter one day (Onizuka was playing \"where's the nipple\" with his daughter, at a karaoke bar in town).\n\nHis personal mode of transportation is a Kawasaki Z2 motorcycle 750cc type S. The bike itself is also featured heavily in the prequel series to GTO."

He has superb fighting skills that only make use of his legs, in an effort to minimize damage to his hands which would impair his cooking skills. Sanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef \"Red Leg\" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue.\n\nSanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his \"love-cook\" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. This behavior has earned him the nickname \"ero-cook,\" or perverted cook. He can also be very chivalrous and gentlemanly around women, volunteering to help them in various tasks and situations, whether they need help or not. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can't attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a \"strict upbringing.\" To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur.\n\nHis goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe.\n\nBeing the crew's chef, he looks out for the health of his crewmates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He's also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well. In short, he cares as much for the crew as any Straw Hat should, but unlike Zoro, Sanji shows these feelings more."

Yukiteru's condition and actions are recorded every ten minutes in her \"Yukiteru\" diary, it also provides small commentary made by Yuno in some of the entries. Its most obvious weakness is that it does not show Yuno's future at all—her condition, situation, or surroundings—unless it somehow involves Yuki. Working with Yukiteru's \"Random Diary\" diary, however, covers both of their diaries' individual flaws; as it has been said the two make for a perfect combo.\n\nSmart, beautiful and diligent—those who don't truly know Gasai Yuno would simply see the model student role she plays while at school. She is secretly obsessed with Yukiteru and would do anything within her power to assist him. She can be quite clingy and is highly fond of stalking him. When obstacles arise that either endangers Yukki's life or threatens their relationship, her thoughts turn murderous and she lets nothing get in the way of her path. Yuno is also able to quickly analyze and adapt to unexpected situations that may arise, and she puts thoughts into action without hesitation, performing what needs to be done without ever losing her nerves. These traits make her one of the strongest players in Deus's game, despite having one of the weakest diaries for providing self survival aid. And while Yukiteru is credited for triggering the greatest shift in future occurrences, Yuno is the one who has created the largest influence in those events. Yuno tends to carry around a box cutter with her at all times, though she will make use of other weaponry such as kitchen knives, hatchets, etc, when required.\n\n\nShe is named after Juno (pronounced yu-no in Latin), the Roman goddess of Motherhood and Femininity."

                "about": "Age: 18\nHeight: 165 cm\nWeight: 55 kg\n\nKoyomi Araragi is a third year high school student who survived a vampire attack during spring break and barely regained his human life in the time that followed as a boy with remnants of vampiric traits. He can see in the dark, his eyes turn red when he gets angry, and he heals incredibly fast. As a result, he questions his lifespan. He remains scared of morning sunlight despite the fact that it no longer has any negative effects on him.\n\nKoyomi is a laid-back person whose only real friend at school is Tsubasa Hanekawa. He's a poor student, close to failing every class except math.\n\nIt is revealed through conversations that he's quite knowledgeable with anime; a fact even noted by Nadeko Sengoku once.\n\nAlthough he is shown to be attracted to the other girls, he turns their advances down due to his loyalty to Hitagi.\n\nOther characters seems to speculate that Koyomi is a lolicon, particularly Mayoi and Hitagi, with Hitagi thinking that Nadeko is a \"threat\" to her.\n\nHe is very noble, which is why Hitagi is attracted to him. He is willing to help others at the cost of his own life. As such, the female characters he has helped are quite attached to him. He feels most comfortable talking to Mayoi, Shinobu and, from the Second Season on, to Yotsugi about his problems.\n\nKoyomi is the only person who thinks that his family relationship is bad, with Karen and Tsukihi thinking otherwise. His parents were revealed to be police officers.\n\nHis personality is portrayed more clearly in the novels, where his inner thoughts show him to be much more perverted and intelligent than the anime leads one to believe.\n\nDue to events prior to Kizumonogatari and Bakemonogatari, Koyomi avoided having friends and seemed to have lost faith and trust in people and himself.\n\n(Source: Bakemonogatari Wikia, edited)"

With his parents and family now gone, his brother spared him and left him to survive by himself. He told Sasuke to hate him. Sasuke tried to forget about the past by applying himself in the ninja academy and fitting in with the rest of the leaf village.\n\nAfter his fight with Naruto, he believes he's been wasting his time \"playing ninja\" with the people of the leaf village. His new goal is to get stronger so he can avenge his clan by killing Itachi and then restore the Uchiha clan.\n\nAs a wielder of the Sharingan (the kekkei genkai of the Uchiha clan), he learns to use Chidori and has a vast knowledge of the various Fire Jutsus. The curse seal which Orichimaru gives him during the Chuunin exam, at first, enhanced his power but at the risk of killing him. Now he can use it of his own free will.\n\nClaiming at first that he doesn't need any friends, he is forced to contradict himself when he sees that either Naruto or Sakura are in danger. Remembering this type of Sasuke is what brings motivation to Naruto. Sasuke openly admitted to Naruto that he was his closest friend.\n\nAppearance\nSasuke has black hair with a blue tint that lengthens as the story goes with onyx eyes and has lighter skin than his brother Itachi. Like many other members of his clan, his hair hangs over both sides of his face to roughly his cheeks. In his curse seal form, he has grey skin with wings on his back that resemble giant webbed hands. He also has hair similar to Madara Uchiha except in a greyish-blue color.\n\nAt the beginning of Part I, Sasuke's clothing made up a blue, short-sleeved shirt with a raised collar and the Uchiha crest on the back and white shorts. An interesting thing is that during Part I the Uchiha symbol on his back gets smaller each time he changes his outfit. In the last stage of the Chunin exams, he wore a black, one pieced version of this outfit but eventually went back to his original clothes.\n\nIn Part II, Sasuke has grown noticeably taller (almost eye height with Itachi) and slightly more muscular. wears a white long sleeved shirt that's open at the torso with a smaller version of the Uchiha crest on his collar. He wears black pants with a blue cloth hanging from his half way up his stomach to his knees. He also wears a purple rope belt (Japanese name: Shimenawa) tied in a bow fashion found on many Sound ninja, only the bow is in a different style and is tied in the front instead of the back. He also will at points remove his shirt and hang it from his belt around his waist to give his wings in Curse Seal Level 2 room to move (also without transforming)."

She made a promise with men from a town called Pasloe where she would ensure the town would have good wheat harvests year after year. However, as time went on, the townspeople slowly started to forsake Holo and did not rely on her as they once did. As such, Holo escapes from town in Lawrence's wagon and started traveling with him to see how much the world has changed since she has been in Pasloe. Holo has chosen the form of a girl younger than Lawrence, though she still retains her large white-tipped wolf tail, and ears. Her true form is that of a very large wolf which many people revered and feared.\n\nShe refers to herself as the \"Wise Wolf of Yoitsu\" (ヨイツの賢狼). She is typically very haughty and self-sufficient, though due to her isolation for hundreds of years in Pasloe, she gradually feels very lonely, and sometimes shows a more fragile side of herself. She relies on Lawrence for company as she fears loneliness, which is something that Lawrence is very aware of and tries to comfort her in his own way. Holo is also very aware of the different time spans that she and Lawrence have, as a human lifespan is like a blink of an eye for her kind. Holo is quite scared of that fact, but hides it with jokes. She has a peculiar way of speaking, modeled after that of the oiran high-class courtesans. She is fond of delicious food and alcohol, but especially loves apples. She takes pride in her tail and takes special care of it, constantly combing and maintaining it.\n\nNote: Concerning the spelling of Holo's name, Yen Press has stated that they \"were instructed that the proper spelling of the character's name is indeed Holo\" by the Japanese licensor."

Shortly following his birth, Gokuu is sent from his native planet Vegeta to Earth, for potential selling on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life; Goku was also sent away to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Once he lands on Earth, he is adopted by an old man named Gohan (who is later just called Grandpa Gohan). At first, Goku is very violent as a kid due to his Saiyan blood, but due to an injury to his head that caused him severe amnesia, Gokuu changes to a more tempered, innocent boy. At the start of the series, Gokuu meets Bulma, Yamucha, Oolong, and Pu'ar, whose characters mirror those found in Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West. He also encounters Kuririn, who eventually becomes his best friend, and others during his journey for more strength. Participating in several World Martial Arts Tournaments, Gokuu also battles foes-turned-allies such as Tenshinhan and Chaozu, as well as the offspring of Demon King Piccolo named Majunior (later, he's named just Piccolo).\n\nDragon Ball Z takes place 5 years after Gokuu's victory against Piccolo in the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. He now has a son named Son Gohan (named after Grandpa Gohan) who lacks his father's love of fighting but has a great hidden potential himself. Throughout the series, Gokuu &amp; Gohan face terribly strong opponents like other powerful Saiyans, a space tyrant, artificial humans, Majins &amp; Gods that threaten Earth while also giving them exhilarating fights. Along with new enemies, they also gain new friends that help in these situations. As well as becoming more powerful, Gokuu learns to accept his forgotten Saiyan heritage (this gives him a small identity crisis when Raditz reveals his past, and is something he carries with him into the proceeding Namek arc) &amp; consistently comes across the predicament of killing an opponent (he starts out killing without much thought to the moral consequences of taking a life, and only after training under Kami does he start to struggle with killing a person; this comes to a head when he fights Freeza on Namek).\n\nIn Dragon Ball GT, which is not based on Toriyama's manga, Gokuu is turned into a child by Pilaf via the Black-Star Dragon Balls. The series revolves around him traveling around space to find the Black Star Dragon Balls with the help of his granddaughter Pan and Trunks. After collecting the spheres, Gokuu does battle with Baby (a Tuffle who wants revenge on all Saiyans for killing his race), Super 17 (a powered-up version of former enemy Artificial Human 17) and various Evil Dragons (the physical constructs of negative energy accumulated in the Dragon Balls; they are called Shadow Dragons in FUNimation's dub). The series ends with Gokuu leaving for good with Shenron and returning 100 years later to witness the match between Gokuu Jr. and Vegeta Jr.\n\nIn Dragon Ball Online (which takes place 216 years after Dragon Ball Z, in which Toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story, unlike Dragon Ball GT), a new villain by the name of Miira appears with the goal to obtain Gokuu's DNA.\n\nIn Cross Epoch, the Dragon Ball and One Piece crossover one-shot, Gokuu is seen accompanying Luffy to attend a party hosted by Shenron from whom key characters from both series had received an invitation.\n\nIn Dragon Ball Minus, it is revealed that Gokuu was sent away by his mother and father (Gine &amp; Bardock) to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Gokuu leaves Planet Vegeta in his pod with a forlorn look as his parents send him away.\n\nGokuu is known for his laid-back personality and his love of fighting worthy opponents. He will eat anything without much qualms. He has an uncanny ability to make allies out of foes he has fought (in some cases to the death), though his capacity for sparing his enemies has occasionally been criticized as foolish (Gokuu generally only fights to win and improve himself, and spares his enemies after winning only for them to attack him when his back is turned). Gokuu can also be very blunt, and not afraid to express his opinion in a discussion, such as when he questioned Krillin's marriage to Android 18 (who was not fully human and a previous enemy who threatened his life). Despite his kind-hearted nature, Gokuu can feel incredible anger in cases of extreme turmoil, such as the death of a close friend/relative, or when someone murders many innocents needlessly. He has a simple, practical view of the world and is somewhat naive to the world around him. Because of this, many characters incorrectly assume him to be somewhat stupid, although once he has a basic understanding of things, he learns very quickly. His most remarkable ability is his will to succeed, his tenacity and persistence.\n\nHe's so focused on improving himself as a warrior that some of the decisions he makes are detrimental to the survival of humanity or those who he cares about. Such examples include when he purposefully chose not to help his friends and family when they were attacked by Beerus at Bulma's birthday so as to study his opponent, or when he elected not to destroy Gero's lab in favor of his curiosity at his potential opponents' strength even though it might've meant the destruction of mankind. This is also touched upon when he spares Vegeta for a rematch in the Saiyan arc, despite this also being a threat to humanity. However, he has shown to be able to slightly curb this selfishness, as he elected to not return to life after dying in the fight against Cell so that Earth would not be endangered by the evil people he tends to attract (although, Goku is also interested in fighting the masters in the afterlife indicating some slight selfishness was still apparent).\n\nGoku has also admitted to not being good at creating things, and being better at breaking stuff at the end of Dragon Ball Kai. In Dragon Ball Super Ep. 4, Goku is revealed not to be much of a party-goer. He has also shown an affinity with training younger kids (like how he did with Gohan in the Androids arc, Goten &amp; Trunks in the Buu arc, and Uub at the end of the series).\n\n(Source: Dragon Ball Super Exciting Character Guide)"

Due to the way she was raised in the Shinomiya Family, she instinctively looks down on other people and thinks of ways to use them for her own benefit. Kaguya rarely interacted with other people before she joined the student council, but that has begun to change. She is an incredibly sheltered girl, resulting in her lacking in several pieces of what might be considered common sense. She still does not understand love very well, and her main objective is to make Miyuki Shirogane fall in love with and confess to her."

            "about": "Joutarou is a fictional character from the Japanese manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, and the protagonist of Series 3. He has a recognizable attire of trenchcoat-length school uniform jacket with yellow chains on the collar.\n\nHe also wears a trademark hat which, while torn in the back, often seems to blend with his hair. While they are first shown as being completely separate, later publications cause more uncertainty as to where his hat and his hair actually meet. His hat is most likely a Japanese student cap that was normally worn along with the gakuran prior to the 1970s.\n\nHe is also known for a quick and short temper. He is the only JoJo to make an appearance in four different series.\n\nJoutarou is Holly Kuujou's son and Joseph Joestar's grandson. When Joutarou first appears, he turned himself in to the police because he believes his Stand is an evil spirit possessing him. To demonstrate, he steals a gun from a prison guard, and tries to shoot himself in the head—a phantom hand emerges from his arm and catches the bullet, however, only Holly sees the hand. This act naturally earned the widespread fear of the guards and other prisoners towards him.\n\nJoseph comes to Joutarou's aid with Mohammed Avdol. A brief fight ensues due to Joutarou's defiance, getting Avdol involved. After he is released from jail, and learns what his Stand is, Joutarou gets used to Star Platinum, a fierce, muscular, vaguely Aztec-looking spirit with \"the precision of a machine\" and the ability to destroy virtually anything with a \"Fist of the North Star\"-like sledgehammer barrage of fists.\n\nIn the sixth story arc Stone Ocean, Joutarou becomes an oceanologist, moves to the United States, eventually marries, and his daughter, Jolyne inherits Stand powers. But she also inherits the tradition of adventures that Joutarou tends to get entangled in. She also adopts an outfit style similar to his at one point due to her fascination and respect for her father.\n\nHe has a very tough exterior (despite the profile image indicating nothing of the sort), and is even rather rough and delinquent, but he also is very dedicated, intense, and loyal. He is very intelligent, but usually lets his (or Star Platinum's) fists do the talking with the enemy, even though he often has to rely on his wits to deal with stand users' attacks. Joutarou has a perpetual cooler-than-thou, slightly disinterested attitude, although he loves his mother and respects his grandfather. It is not that he is unaware of his own love and/or respect—rather, he thinks anyone can tell his emotions just by looking at him, and probably thinks further effort in portraying how he feels to be a waste of time. In the manga, he's constantly chased by adoring girls, whom he ignores or tries to drive away. He is the main target of Dio, who realizes that Joutarou is his greatest threat.\n\nIn part 6, he also shows his protective father side, often taking near fatal blows for Jolyne and throttling her out of harm's way. After he is \"revived,\" Anasui, one of Jolyne's companions who is enthralled by her, asked Joutarou to approve of marrying her. Although he first acted deaf, Joutarou got the picture when he saw her lean against Anasui's chest. Not ready to see his daughter married off right away, he pulled his daughter into his arms, leaving Jolyne clueless to their interactions. His father, a jazz musician, is thought to receive his namesake from Sadao Watanabe, a jazz saxophonist. His father is always on tour and is never seen.\n\nJoutarou is both fierce and gentle, and he shows these traits in various scenes, from the fight with N'Dour to the encounter with D'Arby. One shining example is how he spared Noriaki Kakyoin, instead of destroying him outright, knowing that Kakyoin attacked him unwillingly and was under Dio's influence. The same happened for Polnareff, whom he saved as well. Both became invaluable allies to the end. Unlike with both D'Arby brothers, who got the full brunt of Joutarou's ferocity, he saw in N'Dour blind loyalty rather than greed and evil that was evident with the other enemies. Though still loyal to Dio, N'Dour respected Joutarou for his strength, despite being an enemy, until he breathed his last. In return, Joutarou gave N'Dour a decent burial in the desert.\n\nJoutarou's appearance is interesting in that he exhibits an anime archetype exhibited commonly by \"genius\" characters by forever staying young through all of his appearances in spite of age.\n\nHis catchphrase is \"Yare yare daze.\" It has no direct translation but it is usually translated to the effect of, \"Gimme a break.\" It can also mean \"Well well well...\" or \"all-right all-right...,\" since \"yare yare\" commonly translates to \"Oh well...\" It generally relates of being bored or exasperation. In the official Shonen Jump Advanced manga this is written as \"Give me a !@$&amp;*# break..\"\n\nIn the manga, Joutarou is seen reading a Shounen Jump in his cell, with Shounen Jump being the magazine in which JoJo is published in Japan. These magazines also saved Joutarou from being fatally impaled by Dio's knives.\n\nHe is regarded by many as the most charismatic character of the JoJo series.\n\nOne of the strongest stands in the JoJo universe; Star Platinum possesses super human senses, strength, stamina, accuracy and speed. It can see for great distances and at great magnifications. As an added bonus, it has a \"Star Finger\" attack in which it extends its finger to attack. It is similar to Dio's The World stand, and, it turns out, can likewise be used to stop time, but that ability is only revealed in Joutarou's epic battle with Dio Brando when Dio was about to drop a steamroller on him.\n\nThe Star card symbolizes, above all, hope. This is very appropriate, since Joutarou is very much the young new hope of the series. Like other physically powerful stands, Star Platinum suffers from a narrow range of activity. It can only be active within a 2-3 meter radius from Joutarou.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

She also has good manners, to the point where she cares a lot about manners.

When Itsuki proposes to share their cakes, Ichika suspects that his real goal is to try all the flavors. Itsuki worries about Fuutarou, but it's really because he's hungry.\n\nAccording to Ichika, Fuutarou has to be firm to deal with Nino and kind to deal with Itsuki.\n\n(Source: Gotoubun no Hanayome Wiki)"

She wields a free spirited style of performance that emphasizes emotions and artistry over the pure mechanics of music, such playing to specific tempos and dynamics originally intended by the composer. Her style of music is what rekindles Kousei's passion for the piano and inspires him to redefine himself as a musician.\n\nIn addition, she has the ability to play the melodica and has had some experience playing the piano.\n\n\n\n\n(Source: Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso Wikia)"

That's something I've had since I was born. If you tell me to rule such a world, I already rule it.\"\n\nRin is a model student and idol of Shirou's school. She barely talks to other students in her school and exhibits a desire to be left alone as exemplified by her tendency to stay on the school's rooftop, away from the rest of the students. She is secretly a Magus and a Master in the Fifth Holy Grail War. In the beginning of the anime, she summons Archer for her Servant, although she originally wanted to summon Saber. Rin is reared as the successor to her family's magecraft, instructed by her father Tokiomi Toosaka to prioritize sorcery over her own interests.\n\nTwo centuries ago, the Toosaka House, in collaboration with the estates of Makiri and Einzbern, helped found the Fuyuki Holy Grail Wars. The land of Fuyuki City, which possessed the second greatest spiritual power in all Japan, was owned by Rin's ancestor, Nagato Toosaka; at the behest of the Einzberns, he provided his property as battleground for present and future wars. Nagato was a kirishitan, as well as a pupil of Zelretch; these titles gave him considerable influence in both the Mage's Association and the Church, allowing the Toosaka family to participate in the Holy Grail Wars, free from harassment by either organization.\n\nRin was brought up as the successor to her family's magecraft, and was instructed by her father to prioritize magecraft over her own interests. Ten years ago, Tokiomi Toosaka was selected as a Master in the 4th Holy Grail War, and Rin was entrusted to take care of the Toosaka estate until his return. Her mother, Aoi Toosaka, was left in a debilitated state from the war, so her care was left to her guardian, Kirei Kotomine. After her father was killed, Rin continued to improve her sorcery with some guidance from Kirei Kotomine. To divert attention from her private life, Rin has diligently strived to earn the admiration of her peers, even though she is secretly stingy, tomboyish, and a slacker.\n\nThe rights to the Toosaka lands were inherited by Aoi after Tokiomi's death, and subsequently inherited by Rin after Aoi's death. Kirei managed them as Rin's guardian, and because of his foolhardy and coarse management, the majority of profitable properties ended up in the hands of others. It is possible that he believed the wealth was bad for her upbringing due to following the principles of humility and poverty.\n\nAlthough Rin resents the sacrifices she has endured for the sake of tradition, she is fiercely competitive and eager to prove herself as a skilled and capable magus. She was immensely disappointed at summoning Archer and ended up in a quarrel with him; however, the duo soon reconciled, set aside their differences and quickly got along.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

            "about": "Johan Liebert is the namesake \"monster\" of the story and the mystery of his past is the focus of the plot. He has been called a monster, the next Adolf Hitler and even the devil himself. Johan Liebert was shot in the head at a young age but saved from death by Dr. Tenma. Because of this, he is very grateful to Dr. Tenma. He has spent portions of his life in different places under different aliases and possesses an extraordinary level of charisma and intelligence. He uses his gifts to cruelly manipulate and corrupt others, often with no apparent end other than to cause suffering and destruction. His original goal, as he stated when he was young, is to be the last one standing at the end of the world, although towards the end he decides upon a different fate. One of the themes of Monster is how individuals are capable of transforming into monsters; Johan often acts as both a direct and indirect catalyst for this transformation. Johan also shows strong attachment to his twin sister, Nina Fortner/Anna Liebert and refuses to leave her behind."

He claims to love the entire human race except for Shizuo Heiwajima, and exhibits said love by putting humans in often miserable conditions and observing their reactions.\n\nHe attended Raira Academy with Shizuo, Shinra and Kadota. According to Shinra, Izaya and Shizuo hated each other with a passion almost from the point they met. In the novels Izaya framed Shizuo for crimes on several occasions. In the anime he puts Shizuo in constant problems, such as gangs attacking him daily up to framing him of crimes.\n\nHe is a master of parkour, and also quite skilled with his flickblade (the blade he uses must be slightly opened before the mechanics of it springs opens the blade—a switchblade will open on its own after the user presses a switch) as he is implied to be the only one capable of leaving numerous cuts in Shizuo's bartender suit after a fight in the novels. In the anime, he shaves a gang member's head bald without him noticing it. He is also fluent in Russian, which is exhibited in the final episode and episode 13 when he speaks with Simon.\n\nIzaya has two younger sisters, Mairu and Kururi, who are twins and troublemakers. He claims to have grown up in a normal family whose only abnormal trait was their naming habits. He does not like his sisters and finds them to be unlovable, saying that if even he can not like them, he expects no one else to ever be able to either.\n\nHis name comes from a combination of the biblical Isaiah and Japanese for \"the one who looks over the crowd.\"\n\nIn the novels, Shinra is the only person that Izaya doesn't consider as one of his \"humans.\" Rather, Izaya considers Shinra as his only friend (which is rather rare)."

His hair is especially very messy when he wakes up.\n\nHe is shown to be a quiet student, and never concerned about things that happen around him. Despite being shown as an average high school student, he is quite intelligent and perceptive. The reason for his usual laziness is because he wishes to \"save energy.\" Even though he is shown to be quite lazy, he never leaves his homework undone, as pointed out by Satoshi. He's considered lazy and apathetic, always living on the \"gray\" side, and is not interested in any activities that might waste his time and energy. He actually never intended to join any club, but his sister ordered him to join the Classics Club to save it from being disbanded.

He is frequently partnered with fellow Fairy Tail members Happy, Lucy Heartfilia, Gray Fullbuster, and Erza Scarlet.\n\nHe is commonly known to the public as a powerful mage called \"The Salamander.\" But this title has started to fade as the series progresses.\n\nNatsu's most prominent features are his spiky rosy-colored hair and his signature scaly white scarf which was given to him by Igneel. Natsu has a scar on the right side of his neck.\n\n\nHe has no separate eye color, his eyes instead being solely the color of his black pupils. Natsu is of regular height, and his body is toned but not noticeably muscular. His member's stamp is located at the top of his right arm, just below his shoulder.\n\nNatsu has a carefree and reckless nature and, despite his constant brawls with the other members of the guild, is a fiercely loyal and protective friend. He has a particularly close, and competitive relationship with fellow members; Gray Fullbuster and Erza Scarlet. With the former, he has had a constant rivalry from a young age and although they often denounce each other as not being friends, they regularly watch each others' back even when they are enraged with one another. He has had the same sort of relationship with Erza—the two both being scared of her since a young age—and they seemed to have a fairly good relationship in the past as, according to Erza, they used to shower together. He befriends people rather quickly too, considering Lucy a friend and willing to team up with her only after a few days of knowing her.\n\nNatsu's father had left him when he was young. Igneel, a dragon, found him in the forest and ended up taking care of him. He taught Natsu how to speak, and use magic. But one day Igneel disappeared on July 7, X777; Igneel left Natsu to fend for himself without so much as a goodbye or an explanation for his reasons for doing so. This made Natsu look forward to the next time that they would meet."

He often describes himself through the phrase \"Because I am simply one hell of a butler\" (わたしはあくまで執事ですから, Watashi wa akumade shitsuji desu kara). The phrase plays on the word \"demon\" (あくま, akuma) and the phrase \"to the end\" (あくまで, akumade). It can also translate to \"I am a demon and a butler.\"\n\nSebastian is highly skilled in any area and handles every task, no matter how impossible it is as well as any problem that arises from the errors of the other staff with ease, stating it is only natural as the butler to the Phantomhive family. This is due to the fact he is a demon bound by a Faustian contract to abide by Ciel's will. A sign similar to the one marking Ciel's right eye can be found on Sebastian's left hand, which has been used on one occasion to twist the arm of a kidnapper without touching him."

            "about": "Race: Saiyan\nHeight: 5'9\" (175.3 cm)\nWeight: 187 lbs (85.4 kg)\nBirth year: 737 Age\nHobby: Fighting strong opponents\nFavorite food: Everything\nFavorite vehicle: Kintoun (Nimbus)\n\nOriginally named Kakarot, Gokuu is born a member of a race of extraterrestrials called the Saiyans. Shortly following his birth, Gokuu is sent from his native planet Vegeta to Earth, for potential selling on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life; Goku was also sent away to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Once he lands on Earth, he is adopted by an old man named Gohan (who is later just called Grandpa Gohan). At first, Goku is very violent as a kid due to his Saiyan blood, but due to an injury to his head that caused him severe amnesia, Gokuu changes to a more tempered, innocent boy. At the start of the series, Gokuu meets Bulma, Yamucha, Oolong, and Pu'ar, whose characters mirror those found in Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West. He also encounters Kuririn, who eventually becomes his best friend, and others during his journey for more strength. Participating in several World Martial Arts Tournaments, Gokuu also battles foes-turned-allies such as Tenshinhan and Chaozu, as well as the offspring of Demon King Piccolo named Majunior (later, he's named just Piccolo).\n\nDragon Ball Z takes place 5 years after Gokuu's victory against Piccolo in the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. He now has a son named Son Gohan (named after Grandpa Gohan) who lacks his father's love of fighting but has a great hidden potential himself. Throughout the series, Gokuu &amp; Gohan face terribly strong opponents like other powerful Saiyans, a space tyrant, artificial humans, Majins &amp; Gods that threaten Earth while also giving them exhilarating fights. Along with new enemies, they also gain new friends that help in these situations. As well as becoming more powerful, Gokuu learns to accept his forgotten Saiyan heritage (this gives him a small identity crisis when Raditz reveals his past, and is something he carries with him into the proceeding Namek arc) &amp; consistently comes across the predicament of killing an opponent (he starts out killing without much thought to the moral consequences of taking a life, and only after training under Kami does he start to struggle with killing a person; this comes to a head when he fights Freeza on Namek).\n\nIn Dragon Ball GT, which is not based on Toriyama's manga, Gokuu is turned into a child by Pilaf via the Black-Star Dragon Balls. The series revolves around him traveling around space to find the Black Star Dragon Balls with the help of his granddaughter Pan and Trunks. After collecting the spheres, Gokuu does battle with Baby (a Tuffle who wants revenge on all Saiyans for killing his race), Super 17 (a powered-up version of former enemy Artificial Human 17) and various Evil Dragons (the physical constructs of negative energy accumulated in the Dragon Balls; they are called Shadow Dragons in FUNimation's dub). The series ends with Gokuu leaving for good with Shenron and returning 100 years later to witness the match between Gokuu Jr. and Vegeta Jr.\n\nIn Dragon Ball Online (which takes place 216 years after Dragon Ball Z, in which Toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story, unlike Dragon Ball GT), a new villain by the name of Miira appears with the goal to obtain Gokuu's DNA.\n\nIn Cross Epoch, the Dragon Ball and One Piece crossover one-shot, Gokuu is seen accompanying Luffy to attend a party hosted by Shenron from whom key characters from both series had received an invitation.\n\nIn Dragon Ball Minus, it is revealed that Gokuu was sent away by his mother and father (Gine &amp; Bardock) to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Gokuu leaves Planet Vegeta in his pod with a forlorn look as his parents send him away.\n\nGokuu is known for his laid-back personality and his love of fighting worthy opponents. He will eat anything without much qualms. He has an uncanny ability to make allies out of foes he has fought (in some cases to the death), though his capacity for sparing his enemies has occasionally been criticized as foolish (Gokuu generally only fights to win and improve himself, and spares his enemies after winning only for them to attack him when his back is turned). Gokuu can also be very blunt, and not afraid to express his opinion in a discussion, such as when he questioned Krillin's marriage to Android 18 (who was not fully human and a previous enemy who threatened his life). Despite his kind-hearted nature, Gokuu can feel incredible anger in cases of extreme turmoil, such as the death of a close friend/relative, or when someone murders many innocents needlessly. He has a simple, practical view of the world and is somewhat naive to the world around him. Because of this, many characters incorrectly assume him to be somewhat stupid, although once he has a basic understanding of things, he learns very quickly. His most remarkable ability is his will to succeed, his tenacity and persistence.\n\nHe's so focused on improving himself as a warrior that some of the decisions he makes are detrimental to the survival of humanity or those who he cares about. Such examples include when he purposefully chose not to help his friends and family when they were attacked by Beerus at Bulma's birthday so as to study his opponent, or when he elected not to destroy Gero's lab in favor of his curiosity at his potential opponents' strength even though it might've meant the destruction of mankind. This is also touched upon when he spares Vegeta for a rematch in the Saiyan arc, despite this also being a threat to humanity. However, he has shown to be able to slightly curb this selfishness, as he elected to not return to life after dying in the fight against Cell so that Earth would not be endangered by the evil people he tends to attract (although, Goku is also interested in fighting the masters in the afterlife indicating some slight selfishness was still apparent).\n\nGoku has also admitted to not being good at creating things, and being better at breaking stuff at the end of Dragon Ball Kai. In Dragon Ball Super Ep. 4, Goku is revealed not to be much of a party-goer. He has also shown an affinity with training younger kids (like how he did with Gohan in the Androids arc, Goten &amp; Trunks in the Buu arc, and Uub at the end of the series).\n\n(Source: Dragon Ball Super Exciting Character Guide)"

Though originally born without a Quirk, he manages to catch the attention of the legendary hero All Might and has since become his close pupil and a student at UA.\n\nIzuku is a very timid and polite boy. Due to being bullied since childhood for being born without a Quirk, he is initially portrayed as insecure, being more reserved and not self expressive, especially in front of Katsuki. However, after being accepted into UA and facing Katsuki during Battle Training, he has gradually become more confident and brave.\n\nIzuku is also very diligent and strong willed. Since he greatly admires Heroes and has always aimed to be one, he has a habit of writing down in his notebooks all he knows about heroes and their quirks, including other UA students. He is a very caring person, and will never hesitate to rescue someone in danger, even if he knows he's not strong enough. When someone has a personal problem, Izuku will always try to help, even if it's not his business. Izuku also has the tendency to overthink with anything that grabs his attention, which makes him start mumbling to himself a lot.\n\n(Source: Boku no Hero Academia Wiki)"

            "about": "Joutarou is a fictional character from the Japanese manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, and the protagonist of Series 3. He has a recognizable attire of trenchcoat-length school uniform jacket with yellow chains on the collar.\n\nHe also wears a trademark hat which, while torn in the back, often seems to blend with his hair. While they are first shown as being completely separate, later publications cause more uncertainty as to where his hat and his hair actually meet. His hat is most likely a Japanese student cap that was normally worn along with the gakuran prior to the 1970s.\n\nHe is also known for a quick and short temper. He is the only JoJo to make an appearance in four different series.\n\nJoutarou is Holly Kuujou's son and Joseph Joestar's grandson. When Joutarou first appears, he turned himself in to the police because he believes his Stand is an evil spirit possessing him. To demonstrate, he steals a gun from a prison guard, and tries to shoot himself in the head—a phantom hand emerges from his arm and catches the bullet, however, only Holly sees the hand. This act naturally earned the widespread fear of the guards and other prisoners towards him.\n\nJoseph comes to Joutarou's aid with Mohammed Avdol. A brief fight ensues due to Joutarou's defiance, getting Avdol involved. After he is released from jail, and learns what his Stand is, Joutarou gets used to Star Platinum, a fierce, muscular, vaguely Aztec-looking spirit with \"the precision of a machine\" and the ability to destroy virtually anything with a \"Fist of the North Star\"-like sledgehammer barrage of fists.\n\nIn the sixth story arc Stone Ocean, Joutarou becomes an oceanologist, moves to the United States, eventually marries, and his daughter, Jolyne inherits Stand powers. But she also inherits the tradition of adventures that Joutarou tends to get entangled in. She also adopts an outfit style similar to his at one point due to her fascination and respect for her father.\n\nHe has a very tough exterior (despite the profile image indicating nothing of the sort), and is even rather rough and delinquent, but he also is very dedicated, intense, and loyal. He is very intelligent, but usually lets his (or Star Platinum's) fists do the talking with the enemy, even though he often has to rely on his wits to deal with stand users' attacks. Joutarou has a perpetual cooler-than-thou, slightly disinterested attitude, although he loves his mother and respects his grandfather. It is not that he is unaware of his own love and/or respect—rather, he thinks anyone can tell his emotions just by looking at him, and probably thinks further effort in portraying how he feels to be a waste of time. In the manga, he's constantly chased by adoring girls, whom he ignores or tries to drive away. He is the main target of Dio, who realizes that Joutarou is his greatest threat.\n\nIn part 6, he also shows his protective father side, often taking near fatal blows for Jolyne and throttling her out of harm's way. After he is \"revived,\" Anasui, one of Jolyne's companions who is enthralled by her, asked Joutarou to approve of marrying her. Although he first acted deaf, Joutarou got the picture when he saw her lean against Anasui's chest. Not ready to see his daughter married off right away, he pulled his daughter into his arms, leaving Jolyne clueless to their interactions. His father, a jazz musician, is thought to receive his namesake from Sadao Watanabe, a jazz saxophonist. His father is always on tour and is never seen.\n\nJoutarou is both fierce and gentle, and he shows these traits in various scenes, from the fight with N'Dour to the encounter with D'Arby. One shining example is how he spared Noriaki Kakyoin, instead of destroying him outright, knowing that Kakyoin attacked him unwillingly and was under Dio's influence. The same happened for Polnareff, whom he saved as well. Both became invaluable allies to the end. Unlike with both D'Arby brothers, who got the full brunt of Joutarou's ferocity, he saw in N'Dour blind loyalty rather than greed and evil that was evident with the other enemies. Though still loyal to Dio, N'Dour respected Joutarou for his strength, despite being an enemy, until he breathed his last. In return, Joutarou gave N'Dour a decent burial in the desert.\n\nJoutarou's appearance is interesting in that he exhibits an anime archetype exhibited commonly by \"genius\" characters by forever staying young through all of his appearances in spite of age.\n\nHis catchphrase is \"Yare yare daze.\" It has no direct translation but it is usually translated to the effect of, \"Gimme a break.\" It can also mean \"Well well well...\" or \"all-right all-right...,\" since \"yare yare\" commonly translates to \"Oh well...\" It generally relates of being bored or exasperation. In the official Shonen Jump Advanced manga this is written as \"Give me a !@$&amp;*# break..\"\n\nIn the manga, Joutarou is seen reading a Shounen Jump in his cell, with Shounen Jump being the magazine in which JoJo is published in Japan. These magazines also saved Joutarou from being fatally impaled by Dio's knives.\n\nHe is regarded by many as the most charismatic character of the JoJo series.\n\nOne of the strongest stands in the JoJo universe; Star Platinum possesses super human senses, strength, stamina, accuracy and speed. It can see for great distances and at great magnifications. As an added bonus, it has a \"Star Finger\" attack in which it extends its finger to attack. It is similar to Dio's The World stand, and, it turns out, can likewise be used to stop time, but that ability is only revealed in Joutarou's epic battle with Dio Brando when Dio was about to drop a steamroller on him.\n\nThe Star card symbolizes, above all, hope. This is very appropriate, since Joutarou is very much the young new hope of the series. Like other physically powerful stands, Star Platinum suffers from a narrow range of activity. It can only be active within a 2-3 meter radius from Joutarou.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

She is attributed as the \"first girl\" of the series. Itsuki is serious and diligent, yet she's also a glutton and crybaby.\n\nItsuki is a serious girl, usually getting up early compared to her sisters. She also has good manners, to the point where she cares a lot about manners. She has never been late or skipped a class, and always speaks polite language.\n\nItsuki has been seen to be a girl who holds a grudge, this is shown when she rejects Fuutarou Uesugi's teaching, in part, due to their earlier dispute. She is also someone who cannot be honest with herself and has a hard time being more direct. Both of these qualities often make her fight alone. Itsuki is often too precise in the timing of food cooking.\n\nItsuki sometimes tends to be a crybaby, whether it's due to unfavorable situations, scary things, or her stubborn self.\n\nItsuki has a large appetite and is mainly seen eating throughout the series. It seems like she doesn't mind treating her sisters unfairly when it comes to things related to food. When Itsuki proposes to share their cakes, Ichika suspects that his real goal is to try all the flavors. Itsuki worries about Fuutarou, but it's really because he's hungry.\n\nAccording to Ichika, Fuutarou has to be firm to deal with Nino and kind to deal with Itsuki.\n\n(Source: Gotoubun no Hanayome Wiki)"

She is independent, unpredictable, and short-tempered. It is also touched upon that she is passive aggressive at times. Kaori likes to depend on herself and only herself and can be seen as more of a support for others.\n\nWhile considered a really sloppy violin player from a technical standpoint, such as not following music score sheets the way they are written, Kaori is an amazing violinist. Noted by one of the judges at Towa Hall during the first competition of the series, her pure abilities far exceed the others in the competition. She wields a free spirited style of performance that emphasizes emotions and artistry over the pure mechanics of music, such playing to specific tempos and dynamics originally intended by the composer. Her style of music is what rekindles Kousei's passion for the piano and inspires him to redefine himself as a musician.\n\nIn addition, she has the ability to play the melodica and has had some experience playing the piano.\n\n\n\n\n(Source: Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso Wikia)"

That's something I've had since I was born. If you tell me to rule such a world, I already rule it.\"\n\nRin is a model student and idol of Shirou's school. She barely talks to other students in her school and exhibits a desire to be left alone as exemplified by her tendency to stay on the school's rooftop, away from the rest of the students. She is secretly a Magus and a Master in the Fifth Holy Grail War. In the beginning of the anime, she summons Archer for her Servant, although she originally wanted to summon Saber. Rin is reared as the successor to her family's magecraft, instructed by her father Tokiomi Toosaka to prioritize sorcery over her own interests.\n\nTwo centuries ago, the Toosaka House, in collaboration with the estates of Makiri and Einzbern, helped found the Fuyuki Holy Grail Wars. The land of Fuyuki City, which possessed the second greatest spiritual power in all Japan, was owned by Rin's ancestor, Nagato Toosaka; at the behest of the Einzberns, he provided his property as battleground for present and future wars. Nagato was a kirishitan, as well as a pupil of Zelretch; these titles gave him considerable influence in both the Mage's Association and the Church, allowing the Toosaka family to participate in the Holy Grail Wars, free from harassment by either organization.\n\nRin was brought up as the successor to her family's magecraft, and was instructed by her father to prioritize magecraft over her own interests. Ten years ago, Tokiomi Toosaka was selected as a Master in the 4th Holy Grail War, and Rin was entrusted to take care of the Toosaka estate until his return. Her mother, Aoi Toosaka, was left in a debilitated state from the war, so her care was left to her guardian, Kirei Kotomine. After her father was killed, Rin continued to improve her sorcery with some guidance from Kirei Kotomine. To divert attention from her private life, Rin has diligently strived to earn the admiration of her peers, even though she is secretly stingy, tomboyish, and a slacker.\n\nThe rights to the Toosaka lands were inherited by Aoi after Tokiomi's death, and subsequently inherited by Rin after Aoi's death. Kirei managed them as Rin's guardian, and because of his foolhardy and coarse management, the majority of profitable properties ended up in the hands of others. It is possible that he believed the wealth was bad for her upbringing due to following the principles of humility and poverty.\n\nAlthough Rin resents the sacrifices she has endured for the sake of tradition, she is fiercely competitive and eager to prove herself as a skilled and capable magus. She was immensely disappointed at summoning Archer and ended up in a quarrel with him; however, the duo soon reconciled, set aside their differences and quickly got along.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

He has been called a monster, the next Adolf Hitler and even the devil himself. Johan Liebert was shot in the head at a young age but saved from death by Dr. Tenma. Because of this, he is very grateful to Dr. Tenma. He has spent portions of his life in different places under different aliases and possesses an extraordinary level of charisma and intelligence. He uses his gifts to cruelly manipulate and corrupt others, often with no apparent end other than to cause suffering and destruction. His original goal, as he stated when he was young, is to be the last one standing at the end of the world, although towards the end he decides upon a different fate. One of the themes of Monster is how individuals are capable of transforming into monsters; Johan often acts as both a direct and indirect catalyst for this transformation. Johan also shows strong attachment to his twin sister, Nina Fortner/Anna Liebert and refuses to leave her behind."

If I have to do it, I'll make it quick.\"\n\nOreki is a high-schooler with messy brown hair and green eyes. Due to his very lazy lifestyle, he almost always has a tired or bored look on his face. His hair is especially very messy when he wakes up.\n\nHe is shown to be a quiet student, and never concerned about things that happen around him. Despite being shown as an average high school student, he is quite intelligent and perceptive. The reason for his usual laziness is because he wishes to \"save energy.\" Even though he is shown to be quite lazy, he never leaves his homework undone, as pointed out by Satoshi. He's considered lazy and apathetic, always living on the \"gray\" side, and is not interested in any activities that might waste his time and energy. He actually never intended to join any club, but his sister ordered him to join the Classics Club to save it from being disbanded. Even though he might not seem it, he's unbelievably good at solving mysteries and seems to be able to always find a solution if he gives it a thought. He has a habit of holding his bangs whenever he's thinking about a mystery."

He is frequently partnered with fellow Fairy Tail members Happy, Lucy Heartfilia, Gray Fullbuster, and Erza Scarlet.\n\nHe is commonly known to the public as a powerful mage called \"The Salamander.\" But this title has started to fade as the series progresses.\n\nNatsu's most prominent features are his spiky rosy-colored hair and his signature scaly white scarf which was given to him by Igneel. Natsu has a scar on the right side of his neck.\n\n\nHe has no separate eye color, his eyes instead being solely the color of his black pupils. Natsu is of regular height, and his body is toned but not noticeably muscular. His member's stamp is located at the top of his right arm, just below his shoulder.\n\nNatsu has a carefree and reckless nature and, despite his constant brawls with the other members of the guild, is a fiercely loyal and protective friend. He has a particularly close, and competitive relationship with fellow members; Gray Fullbuster and Erza Scarlet. With the former, he has had a constant rivalry from a young age and although they often denounce each other as not being friends, they regularly watch each others' back even when they are enraged with one another. He has had the same sort of relationship with Erza—the two both being scared of her since a young age—and they seemed to have a fairly good relationship in the past as, according to Erza, they used to shower together. He befriends people rather quickly too, considering Lucy a friend and willing to team up with her only after a few days of knowing her.\n\nNatsu's father had left him when he was young. Igneel, a dragon, found him in the forest and ended up taking care of him. He taught Natsu how to speak, and use magic. But one day Igneel disappeared on July 7, X777; Igneel left Natsu to fend for himself without so much as a goodbye or an explanation for his reasons for doing so. This made Natsu look forward to the next time that they would meet."

He often describes himself through the phrase \"Because I am simply one hell of a butler\" (わたしはあくまで執事ですから, Watashi wa akumade shitsuji desu kara). The phrase plays on the word \"demon\" (あくま, akuma) and the phrase \"to the end\" (あくまで, akumade). It can also translate to \"I am a demon and a butler.\"\n\nSebastian is highly skilled in any area and handles every task, no matter how impossible it is as well as any problem that arises from the errors of the other staff with ease, stating it is only natural as the butler to the Phantomhive family. This is due to the fact he is a demon bound by a Faustian contract to abide by Ciel's will. A sign similar to the one marking Ciel's right eye can be found on Sebastian's left hand, which has been used on one occasion to twist the arm of a kidnapper without touching him."

            "about": "Revy (レヴィ), sometimes referred by her full name Rebecca (レヴェッカ), is the female protagonist of the series. She does most of the fighting for the Lagoon Company. Very little is revealed about her past, although portions can be pieced together through the series. Revy is a Chinese-American born and raised in Chinatown, Manhattan, near Mott Street, spending most of her youth as a thief and murderer. Flashbacks throughout the series reveal that Revy may have honed her skills with firearms by shooting at cans, and that her first murder may have involved shooting an unknown man while using a pillow. It is unknown whether the pillow was used to suppress the noise or to help avoid looking at her first victim.\n\n\nRevy is very competitive, easily bored, and extremely ill-tempered. Unlike Rock, she is undiplomatic, believing in the use of brute force and coercion to get her way. In contrast to this, she's revealed to be highly ticklish.\n\nRevy is a merciless and sadistic killer, without a conscience, who will kill anyone at the slightest provocation, even unarmed civilians (as seen in episode 6). Dutch once made reference to University of Texas shooter Charles Whitman in describing Revy after she slaughtered the crew of the Neo-Nazis' boat after a previous conversation with Rock brought up some unpleasant memories, resulting in an internal fit of rage - she even threatened Rock with death if he ever questions or tampers with her way of life. Of all the characters in the series, Revy uses the most foul language. She takes maniacal glee in killing anyone and everyone. She is also a heavy smoker and drinker.\n\nShe has a changing but volatile attitude towards Rock; though she respects him later in the series, she is mostly hostile towards him. She shot Rock at point blank range, but he moved her gun at the last second, during a confrontation in episode 7, and in episode 1 emptied most of a magazine in his direction while arguing with Dutch about their hostage. However, she does have a tendency to save Rock from critical situations, and later on she admits to considering Rock as family to Balalaika. It is possible that she has an attraction to Rock, based on her reactions to Eda's teasing, which appear to be jealousy.\n\nAccording to CIA agents on Basilan Island, towards the end of episode 12, Revy is still notorious in the NYPD, particularly at the 27th Precinct. Since the 27th Precinct does not exist in real-life New York City, this throwaway reference may - or may not - indicate an odd connection to Dick Wolf's Law and Order franchise. This is further suggested in a later episode, when Revy specifically mentions the series.\n\nRevy is one of the deadliest fighters in the series, whose skill with firearms and ability to dodge bullets is almost superhuman and unparallelel. There are only a few other characters, such as Roberta and Ginji, that can hold their ground against her in combat.\n\nHer weapons of choice are a pair of modified Beretta 92FS's; which are made out of stainless steel and had their barrels extended from 4.9\" to 5.9\" each (the 5.9\" is the combat MOD barrel) and also adapted for silencers. They are engraved with \"9mm Sword Cutlass\" on both sides, as well as the Jolly Roger of the infamous pirate Calico Jack (which is also inlaid into the ivory grips), and a manufacture inscription in Thai. Due to her ambidextrous marksmanship skills, she is nicknamed \"Two Hand\" by the denizens of Roanapur. However, Revy has been seen using a variety of other firearms.\n\nConstantly living on the edge of life, Revy has developed a rather bleak, almost nihilistic outlook on life, relying only on her own power, skills, and money. She does not believe in God or emotions. However, she seems to respect and trust her companions.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

I want to make him mine and become one with him.\"\n\nKurumi Tokisaki is the main antagonist in the series. She is the third Spirit to be encountered in the series and is the most dangerous and lethal Spirit. She is heavily obsessed with Shidou and has the ability to manipulate time. Her codename is Nightmare. She has a split personality: that of a gentle, mysterious high school girl with a slow talking pattern, and that of a psychopathic killer. Kurumi is very aggressive in her actions which makes it harder for Shidou to capture her. Kurumi can be described a person whose personality is hard to read, possessing a well-polished dislike of humanity that borders on mistrust, something she shared with many Spirits in their debut. She is a skilled actress, capable of putting on the façade of an innocent, curious young girl when she needs to, shown when she registered as a student at the Raizen High School, even speaking in a very polite manner; however, under that mask lies a psychotic woman, prone to fits of insane laughter that possesses no regard for human life, regarding them as a food source to restore her own time, and thus, a disposable commodity. There is a twisted justice behind her methods, however, as the people that she brutally murdered were would-be rapists and animal abusers. In hindsight, Kurumi possesses some degree of innocence that her psychotic behavior have not entirely ruined; she has a soft spot for small animals and other creatures. She once slaughtered four humans not because she needed to replenish her time, but because they were trying to kill a kitten, this is the closest to a humanizing emotion that she has. Mana reported that Kurumi is the most dangerous spirit known, who has personally killed over 10,000 people which does not include the spacequake's victims within that statistics. Kurumi used unstated and unexplained methods to personally transfer into Shidou Itsuka's high school and classroom so she can get closer to him. Her purposes and reasons in this transfer are simple; consume Shidou Itsuka, in doing so gain their memories, goals, fears and obsessions. In some non-canon stories, the clone Shidou seduced shows some \"independent\" attitude, almost rebellious, and openly acts lovey-dovey with Shidou, which causes troubles to the \"main\" Kurumi and even leads to confrontation with her. \n\n\nKurumi has the ability to manipulate the 4th dimension, mainly time, but her main power is associated with controlling shadows. Shadow is her primary power while Time is her secondary power in terms of usage. Combined with the power of time, she can create a clone with all her experiences, memories, abilities, etc. These clones however are shadows of her past selves who contain feelings the current Kurumi no longer possesses, Kurumi will kill these clones if they are swayed away from her goals. These clones are less powerful than Kurumi herself as she has mentioned in the last chapter of volume 3 and in the epilogue of volume 4. She can form a single clone by shooting herself with Zafkiel or bring out all of her clones at once from a pool of shadows which she also uses to draw them all back in and all the time they've collected. She can also call her clones partially through small fields of shadows, most often to hold someone in place and prevent them from moving. To activate any power she needs, she first needs to call her Angel (regardless of whether or not the Angel has been summoned already or not), and to position both of her guns just like a clock: The musket on 12 and the flintlock points at the number of the bullet. Next she needs to shoot the bullet at the target with the hand gun. In case she needs it for herself, she will be required to shoot it at her head. She also has the ability to call and dismiss spacequakes at will, as shown in the series while she confronts Shidou on the school's rooftop.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, DAL Wiki)"

He is one of eleven pirates who have been referred to as \"The Eleven Supernovas\" on Sabaody Archipelago whose bounties are higher than  100,000,000 when the Straw Hats arrive in the place. Law is a slim and tall man wearing a black-sleeved yellow shirt with his Jolly Roger on it. He has many tattoos on his arms, as well as a pair of small earrings on both ears. On his left hand in particular are the letters D, E, A, T, and H tattooed on each of his fingers. The word formed from this letters is \"DEATH.\" Law also carries along a nodachi with which he uses with his Devil Fruit powers. It is sword with a scabbard decorated with crosses from the opening to the bottom. Law is an extremely laid-back character, who is nearly always seen smiling (although not with a huge grin, like fellow Supernova Urouge). He also has a more reckless attitude when faced against other pirates that the World Government has labeled as a higher threat: For example, he casually asked X.

However, he hates being ordered around. He is also unfailingly polite, usually referring to others as \"Mr\", and appears to be honorable enough to refuse taking credit that is due to others."

She had a bounty of 79 million beri (One Piece currency)  since she was eight years old, during an incident in which she supposedly destroyed six Buster Call ships through the use of the powers she gained by the eating the Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower or Blooming Blooming Fruit). The fruit's power enables her to conjure up multiple replicas of her body parts (most often her arms) upon any surface she is able to see making her very powerful and dexterous as a result. \n\nRobin joined the Straw Hat Pirates after Luffy saved her life, or (how she states it) Luffy forced her to live when she wanted to die. To atone for his crime, Robin demands that Luffy allow her to join his crew, to which he complies leaving every other crew member except Sanji in shock. Although feared at first, she is quickly accepted and viewed as a comrade by the crew.\n\nRobin is actually an archaeologist of talent, and despises anyone who thoughtlessly damages any piece of history. The World Government fears her because she can decipher Poneglyphs (stones marked with glyphs from an ancient language), which contain details capable of reviving ancient weapons that have the power to destroy the world. In reality, Robin has stated that she does not care about ancient weapons, and that her dream is to find the True History written on the Rio Poneglyph.\n\nRobin is a mysterious and serious person who appears quiet and reclusive, and the wisest in the Straw Hat's Crew. She was thought by those around her to be cold and mean, but it was proven that she is actually a kind person who always thinks before she acts. She often only speaks when something interesting or important has happened. She loves to study history, and the comfort and freedom to study and read. She is also quick to point out gross or realistically morbid facts, often creeping out Nami or Usopp. Robin is the wisest and most sensible member of the crew. She has a vast knowledge of the seas and the world, and usually keeps her head during surprising situations, allowing her to logically analyze the situation without losing her cool. This trait makes her different from the other Straw Hats, who often comically react melodramatically to unexpected happenings and hold irrational ideas and conclusions. Despite her attempts to keep herself distant, Robin has fallen for her new friends, and has taken the role of the distant den mother."

She gets angry and violent whenever people insult her or her peerage, showing a fiery side to her.\n\nShe is proud of her family's name, but she does not like being seen as Rias of the Gremory Family. The reason for her living in the human world (as revealed in Volume 2 of the novels) is because there, everyone sees her as Rias, not as a Devil or as the Crimson-Haired Ruin Princess. Due to this and the fact that the only men who showed interest in her were interested in her due to being the Heiress of the House of Gremory, Rias soured on the idea of finding a lover, until meeting and falling in love with Issei. According to Akeno, Rias originally said that all men looked the same to her as Rias said that Issei is the only exception due to her thinking of him as cute.\n\nShe thinks of Issei as a special person and always gets jealous when girls are around him, becoming a totally different person when she sees him and other girls together, or when it comes to training. Despite her mature stature like a woman, Rias tends to act her true age and becomes frustrated whenever girls flirt with Issei. While Rias is usually calm and mature in most situations, she loses her mature aura and presence when she sees any girl (especially Akeno) flirting with or seducing Issei.\n\nShe enjoys teasing Issei and Asia (from Volume 3 of the novels onward), but at the same time makes it clear (to Asia or any girl) that Issei is hers, and she does not want to share him at all (It is revealed in Volume 3 of the novels that the Gremory Family and their servants are beings with extraordinary affection among the Devils, so Rias is no exception). She has no problem with showing Issei her breasts or sleeping naked with him (which she always does according to her and she claims she can't sleep without being nude or without Issei). Despite being seductive like Akeno, both of the girls are still innocent to love, as both of them become their age whenever around Issei or on a date with him.\n\nAfter becoming Issei's girlfriend, Rias begins to show more confidence in her relationship with Issei and is no longer jealous or angry when Issei is with other girls like she previously was, even accepting Issei's dream of having a harem and letting the girls have dates with him. However, Rias still shows some signs of jealousy such as when Issei doesn't spend enough time with her, but still believes in him and loves him. Due to being Issei's official girlfriend and later fiancée, the other girls acknowledge her as the \"Legal Wife\" as she manages the other women who are in love with Issei. According to Ravel, the burden of Rias as the \"Legal Wife\" is greater than the burden of Issei as she has to manage the girls maidenly feelings towards Issei and balance out Issei's feelings towards each of his lovers/brides. Like Akeno, Rias shows a sign of dependence toward Issei (possibly lesser than the former) as Rias will lose her will to fight and lead. She developed an instinct when Issei is with an unknown woman or other girls tried to seduce him before her she immediately rush to him quickly.\n\nShe holds her older brother, Sirzechs, in high regard (despite her older brother's antics of being a siscon) because she deeply cares for him. When she was a child, she was entirely dependent on him and held him in admiration, while also feeling inferior to him at the same time.\n\nRias loves participating in Rating Games, as she dreams of becoming the Rating Game champion by defeating the current Rating Game champion; Diehauser Belial, with the help of her peerage. While Rias is a powerful devil in her own right, being much stronger than average High-class Devils and according to Azazel, being able to become a Ultimate-class Devil just on the virtue on her talent alone, Rias suffers a bit of an inferiority complex when she compares herself to her fellow Rookies Four colleagues, as she feels inferior to Sona as a strategist and that she is far weaker in power than Sairaorg. However, according to Riser and Azazel, Rias has a talent for finding and recruiting talented individuals for her peerage, inspiring great loyalty and growing stronger with them as seen in her meeting with Issei.  \n\nRias is competitive and hates to lose, especially after losing her first Rating Game against Riser as she strives to always win, whether it is in sports or Rating Games.\n\nDue to being spoiled by her father Zeoticus and her brother Sirzechs from an early age, she has a somewhat impatient and selfish personality and because of her bad money spending habit, her mother Venelana and her sister-in-law Grayfia often scold her for her frivolous spending, as her mother reconsidered the amount of money she is allowed as allowance.\n\nEarly in her childhood, she developed an instinctive fear and hatred of camels due to being hit by a camel after making fun of it, as the fear is great enough that the residents of the Gremory territory constantly keep camels away from her despite the Gremory's association with camels in the Ars Goetia.\n\nDue to being taught about Japan from Souji Okita, Rias has developed an obsession with Japan, buying various Japanese souvenirs and being ecstatic while visiting Kyoto during her school field trip, though she became pouty and stomped at the train station due to being unable to fully explore Kyoto. \n\nPowers &amp; Abilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEquipment\n\n\n\n \n(Source: High School DxD Wiki)"

However, thanks to her requip magic, she can wear many magic armors, and can even requip swim suits, and clothes for recreational purposes. Her member stamp is on her left shoulder. She wears a standard medieval armor, but has a number of other themed armors such as Flame (or Lightning) Empress, which absorb the respected magic type, Adamantium,  Samurai-style and more.\n\nErza is a very strict person, often criticizing the bad behavior and habits of the other guild members, causing most them to apologize for fear that they might invoke her wrath. She is also impatient, liking people who answer her questions quickly as seen when she promptly knocks out anyone who doesn't answer her questions (despite them not knowing anything). Also, Erza has a problem where she apparently sees everyone as guild members (best seen when she asks civilians to take things places during a mission). However, she has a great sense of justice. Despite being a very strict person, she seems to have a clumsy side to her as seen during the Galuna arc when she fell into a pit hole.\n\nLike most Fairy Tail members, she shows great loyalty and dedication to Makarov and the guild. She pushed herself past her limit in the war against the Phantom Lord Guild, fighting against its many powerful members. She also became the temporary leader when Makarov had to be treated because of his scattered magic.\n\nAlthough it hasn't been fully explored, it is implied that Natsu Dragneel, Erza and Gray Fullbuster are all very close to each other. While staying over at Lucy's house, Erza revealed that the three of them used to take showers together. It is later revealed that Erza, Natsu, and Gray have all been part of Fairy Tail ever since they were children.\n\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"

They can be seen as very hyperactive, often diving into projects without thought for personal safety (and frightening lots of subordinates in the process), instead preoccupied with observing and documenting the subjects. Some misunderstand these acts and Hange is seen as eccentric and having more than a few screws loose. They also enjoy discussing this research, but as the lectures can be very long and detail-oriented, not many fellow soldiers find them interesting.\n\nHange is often excited by Titans and is always eager to experiment with them, coming off as extremely emotional regarding titans. For example, they cry at the amount of pain being caused to a Titan during experimentation."
